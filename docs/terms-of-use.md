Last updated: 07/13/2025

Welcome to **Catspace** ("**App**", "**we**", "**us**" or "**our**"). These Terms of Use ("**Terms**") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("**you**" or "**User**") and Catspace regarding your access to and use of the App, our website, and any related services (collectively, the "**Services**"). By downloading, installing, or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Services.

## 1. Eligibility
You must be at least **13 years old** (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) and capable of forming a binding contract to use the Services. By using the App you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.

## 2. Account Registration
Some features require an account. You agree to provide accurate information, keep your credentials confidential, and accept responsibility for all activities under your account. We may suspend or terminate your account if we believe your information is inaccurate or you violate these Terms.

## 3. Description of the Service
Catspace uses computer‑vision and large‑language‑model technologies to **detect cats in images and predict breed, fur pattern, eye color, and other traits**. Results are **probabilistic, not deterministic**. They do **not constitute veterinary, genetic, or professional advice**. Always consult a qualified professional for pet health or breed verification matters.

## 4. Subscriptions & In‑App Purchases
Catspace offers free and paid tiers (e.g., **Pro Access**) that may include offline mode, unlimited scans, or additional features. Prices, billing cycles, and renewal terms are presented in‑app and may change with prior notice. All purchases are processed by the App Store; **Apple’s terms** govern payments, refunds, and cancellations. You can manage or cancel a subscription in your device settings at any time.

## 5. License & Intellectual Property
We grant you a **personal, non‑exclusive, revocable, non‑transferable** license to use the App in accordance with these Terms. All content, trademarks, and intellectual property rights in the Services remain the property of Catspace or its licensors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Services without our prior written consent.

## 6. User Content
You retain ownership of images and other content you upload ("**User Content**"). By uploading User Content you grant us a worldwide, royalty‑free license to process, display, and otherwise use the content solely to provide and improve the Services. You represent that you have all necessary rights to grant this license and that your User Content does not infringe any third‑party rights or violate any law.

## 7. Prohibited Conduct
You agree **not** to:
1. Use the Services for **illegal, harmful, or fraudulent** purposes.
2. Attempt to **reverse engineer** or interfere with the App’s underlying code, models, or security.
3. Upload content that is **unlawful, offensive, or infringes intellectual property rights**.
4. Use automated means (bots, scripts) to access or scrape the Services.
5. Sell or sublicense the Services without our written permission.

## 8. Privacy
Our collection and use of personal information is governed by the Privacy Policy. By using the Services you consent to such processing and you warrant that all data provided is accurate.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties
The services are provided **“as is” and “as available.”** To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement. We do not warrant that the services will be uninterrupted, error‑free, or meet your expectations.

## 10. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Catspace shall not be liable for any **indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages** (including lost profits, data, or goodwill) arising out of or in connection with the services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability to you for any claim arising from the services shall not exceed **the amount you paid us (if any) in the six months preceding the event giving rise to liability**.

## 11. Indemnification
You agree to **indemnify and hold harmless** Catspace, its affiliates, officers, and employees from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Services, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms.

## 12. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful to us or other users. Upon termination, all provisions that by their nature should survive will remain in effect (e.g., intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability).

## 13. Changes to the Services & Terms
We may modify or discontinue the Services at any time. We may also amend these Terms by posting an updated version in‑app or on our website. **Continued use of the Services after the effective date constitutes acceptance** of the revised Terms.

## 14. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of **the Province of Ontario, Canada** without regard to its conflict‑of‑law principles. Any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be resolved in the courts located in **Toronto, Ontario**, unless applicable law requires a different forum.
