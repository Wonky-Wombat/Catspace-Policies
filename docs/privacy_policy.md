# Catspace – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 07/13/2025

Catspace ("**we**", "**us**", or "**our**") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you download, install, or use the Catspace mobile application and any related services (collectively, the "**Services**"). By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Services.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect only the information necessary to operate and improve Catspace, **both now and in the future**. Specifically:

- **Device Information** — device model, operating‑system version, preferred language, and time‑zone. *Used solely for bug diagnostics and performance tuning.*
- **Usage Data** — anonymous events such as screens visited, button taps, and session duration. *Helps us understand which features users find valuable and where the app can be improved.*
- **Images You Provide** — the photos you capture or import for cat detection. *These images are used ******only****** for running our AI model and generating predictions. They are processed in memory and ******deleted immediately after inference******; nothing is stored on our servers unless you explicitly attach the image to feedback you send us.*
- **Subscription & Purchase Data** — Apple‑provided transaction or receipt identifiers. *Needed to validate Pro access and provide customer support.*
- **Optional Account Data** (if you choose to create an account) — email address and display name. *Used to sync history across devices and respond to support requests.*

We **do not** collect biometric identifiers, precise geolocation, or any information unrelated to providing cat‑detection functionality.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide and maintain** the Services, including cat detection and breed analysis.
- **Process transactions** and manage subscriptions.
- **Improve** the accuracy of our AI models and overall user experience *(aggregated, de‑identified analytics only).*
- **Communicate** with you about updates, new features, or support tickets.
- **Ensure security**, detect fraudulent activity, and enforce our Terms of Use.

## 3. On‑Device vs. Cloud Processing On‑Device vs. Cloud Processing

- **By default**, images are processed **locally on your device**.
- If you enable the optional “Cloud Mode,” images are **securely uploaded** to our servers for enhanced accuracy. Images are **deleted within 24 hours** after processing unless you opt‑in to contribute to model improvement.

## 4. Sharing of Information

We do **not sell** your personal data. We may share information only:

- With **service providers** (e.g., Apple for in‑app purchases, analytics platforms) who are bound by confidentiality.
- To comply with **legal obligations** or protect the rights, property, or safety of Catspace or users.
- With your **explicit consent**.

## 5. Data Retention

We keep information only for as long as it is needed for the purposes outlined in this Policy:

- **Images processed locally** — never leave your device unless you opt‑in to contribute to model improvement.
- **Images processed in Cloud Mode** — deleted within **24 hours** of inference.
- **Subscription receipts** — stored for the duration of your subscription **plus 2 years** to meet tax and audit obligations.
- **Analytics events** — retained for **12 months**, then stored only in aggregated, non‑identifiable form.

## 6. Security Security

We implement technical and organizational measures such as **SSL encryption**, **least‑privilege access controls**, and **periodic security reviews**. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The Services are **not directed to children under 13**. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information.

## 8. Your Rights & Choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to **access, correct, delete, or port** your personal data, and to **object or restrict** certain processing. To exercise these rights, contact us at **[privacy@catspace.app](mailto\:jenflow.app@outlook.com)**.

You can disable analytics in the app’s Settings at any time.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify you of material changes via in‑app notice or by updating the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.

## 10. Contact Us

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please email **[privacy@catspace.app](mailto\:jenflow.app@outlook.com)**.

*By using Catspace, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.*
